/*

My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
Multiply each number by itself.
Add them all together.
Take the square root of the result.
Divide by two.
Example
predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86
Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

import 'dart:math';
int predictAge(int age1,int age2, int age3, int age4, int age5, int age6, int age7, int age8) {
   // Step 1: Create a list of the input ages
  List<int> ages = [age1, age2, age3, age4, age5, age6, age7, age8];
  
  // Step 2: Square each age and sum them together
  int sumOfSquares = ages.map((age) => pow(age, 2).toInt()).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  
  // Step 3: Take the square root of the sum and divide by 2
  double result = sqrt(sumOfSquares) / 2;
  
  // Step 4: Round down the result and return it as an integer
  return result.floor();
}
