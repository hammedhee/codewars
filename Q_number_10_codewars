/// You are given a string title consisting of one or more words separated by a single space, where each word consists of English letters. Capitalize the string by changing the capitalization of each word such that:

If the length of the word is 1 or 2 letters, change all letters to lowercase.
Otherwise, change the first letter to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase.
Return the capitalized title.

 

Example 1:

Input: title = "capiTalIze tHe titLe"
Output: "Capitalize The Title"
Explanation:
Since all the words have a length of at least 3, the first letter of each word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase. ///

// ans 


class Solution {
  String capitalizeTitle(String title) {
    return title.split(" ").map((word){
        if (word.length <= 2){
            return word.toLowerCase();
        }else{
            return word[0].toUpperCase() + word.substring(1).toLowerCase();
        }
    }).join(" ");
  }
